Serial Commands for aArtisan
============================

Notes:
 1. Terminate all command strings with newline, i.e. /n
 2. Delimiters between parameters may be comma, space, semicolon
 3. First four characters (max) of command name are significant

CHAN,ijkl
-----------
where i,j,k,l = a decimal value 0 to 4 representing a physical port
Establishes the active logical channels (chan1, chan2, chan3, chan4)
and maps them to physical ports (TC1, TC2, TC3, TC4).  
A value of zero for the physical port inactivates the channel.
Response from TC4 device is "# Active channels set to ijkl"
Examples:
  chan,1200/n  TC1 -> chan1, TC2 -> chan2, chan3 and chan4 inactive
  chan,3210/n  TC3 -> chan1, TC2 -> chan2, TC1 -> chan3, chan4 inactive

UNITS,u
---------
where u = C or F.
Sets active temperature scale.  
No response from TC4 device.

READ
------
Requests current temperature readings on all active channels. 
Response from TC4 device is ambient temperature followed by a 
comma separated list of temperatures in current active units
in logical channel order: ambient,chan1,chan2,chan3,chan4

OT1,duty
-------
where duty = 0 to 100 (percent output)
Changes the PWM duty cycle on OT1 to p.
No response from TC4 device.

OT2,duty
-------
where duty = 0 to 100 (percent output)
Changes the PWM duty cycle on OT2 to p.
No response from TC4 device.

IO3,duty
-------
where duty = 0 to 100 (percent output)
Changes the PWM duty cycle on IO3 to p.
No response from TC4 device.

DWRITE,pin,val
----------------
where pin = Arduino pin number (D0 to D13 or A0 to A5)
      val = HIGH or LOW
Puts port associated with pin number in output mode and sets it HIGH or LOW.
No response from the TC4 device.

AWRITE,pin,level
------------------
where pin = Arduino pin number (D0 to D13)
      val = 0 to 255
Puts port associated with pin number in output mode and sets output level
0 to 255 (i.e. duty cycle 0 to 100%).
No response from the TC4 device.
